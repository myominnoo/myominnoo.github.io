**Domain**: Immunology, Public Health, Infectious Disease

## The Challenge
Tracking SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability across 3–5 booster doses generates high-dimensional, longitudinal datasets. With three types of serology antibodies and various neutralization responses to monitor, static reporting was insufficient. The research team needed a way to visualize complex immune decay patterns and "trajectories" to inform public health strategies and booster protocols in real-time.

## The Solution
I developed a comprehensive Shiny application designed as a communication and analysis hub for cohort surveillance. This platform streamlines the transition from raw serological data to interactive longitudinal insights.

- **Dynamic Trajectory Mapping**: Built interactive visualizations that allow researchers to isolate specific cohorts and booster groups to observe immune trends.
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Integrated disparate outcomes (serology vs. neutralization) into a single, unified interface for comparative study.
- **Engagement-Focused UI & Data Viz**: Developed a user-friendly "wireframe-to-production" interface that simplifies statistical exploration for non-data scientists.

## Technical Deep-Dive
- **Longitudinal and Mixed-Effects Modeling**: Leveraged R to calculate statistics across multiple time points and booster intervals.
- **Tech Stack**: `R`, `Shiny`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `tidyverse`, `lme4`.
- **Impact**: Served as the "comprehensive platform" for the study, enabling deep-dive collaborations with research partners and accelerating the dissemination of findings on long-term vaccine effectiveness.
