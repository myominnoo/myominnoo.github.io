**Domain**: Mucosal Immunology, Transcriptomics, Reproductive Health

## The Challenge
Understanding the spatial and molecular composition of Tissue-Resident Memory (TRM) T cells in the female reproductive tract is critical for developing mucosal vaccines and HIV prevention strategies. However, the interplay between these cells in the ectocervix vs. the endocervix required high-resolution analysis that traditional bulk sequencing cannot provide.

## The Solution
I integrated flow cytometry phenotyping with **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** to map the molecular landscape of the cervical mucosa. This multi-modal approach allowed the research team to move beyond broad cell categories to identify unique, niche-specific T cell clusters.

- **High-Resolution Mapping**: Leveraged scRNA-seq to generate a molecular data matrix at the individual cell level, uncovering distinct molecular signatures for TRM subsets.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Coupled flow cytometry data with transcriptomic profiles to validate the presence and composition of established T cell subsets.
- **Clinical Association Analysis**: Investigated how these cellular compositions correlate with clinical findings from patients at a colposcopy clinic in Nairobi.

## Technical Deep-Dive
- **Bioinformatics Pipeline**: Developed custom R workflows for scRNA-seq processing, including quality control, normalization, dimensional reduction (UMAP/t-SNE), and cluster annotation.
- **Tech Stack**: `R`, `Seurat`, `Bioconductor`, `SingleCellExperiment`, `ggplot2`.
- **Impact**: Resulted in the manuscript *“Enumeration, phenotyping, and clinical associations of tissue-resident T cells in the ecto- and endocervix of women attending a colposcopy clinic”*, accepted in the **American Journal of Reproductive Immunology (2026)**.
