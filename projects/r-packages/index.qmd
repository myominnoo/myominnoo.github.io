Introducing u5mr, an open-source R package designed for estimating child
mortality rates. This package includes the implementation of various
methods to estimate child mortality.

One notable feature of u5mr is its incorporation of the maternal age
cohort-derived (MAC) and period-derived (MAP) methods proposed by
Rajaratnam et al. These methods provide additional flexibility and
accuracy in estimating child mortality rates, enhancing the reliability
of the results.

To learn more about the MAC and MAP methods, refer to the publication by
Rajaratnam et al. available at [Rajaratnam et
al](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000253).
