**Role**: Epidemiologist & Study Data Lead  

**Position**: Postdoctoral Fellowship @ University of Manitoba  

**Domain**: HPV, Project Management, Study Enrollment

## The Challenge
The **SWOP HPV Study** in Nairobi tracks high-risk populations (FSW and MSM) over a one-year period to understand HPV genotype transmission and immunological clearance. Managing longitudinal data for such a study is notoriously difficult; researchers need to monitor "loss to follow-up," identify patterns in viral persistence across multiple visits, and correlate these with mucosal characteristics in real-time.

## The Solution
I designed and implemented a centralized data infrastructure and monitoring dashboard for the study. This system shifted the project from reactive data management to proactive epidemiological surveillance.

- **Cohort Study Tracking**: Built specialized visualizations to monitor participant retention and follow-up success over the one-year study window.
- **mini-LMS**: Tracked logistics and testing of blood samples across sequential clinical visits.
- **Integrated Analytics**: Preliminary analytics on combined epidemiological metadata with mucosal/immunological characteristics to guide student enrollment.

## Technical Deep-Dive
- **Workflow Automation**: Created a reproducible R pipeline to clean and merge data from multiple clinic visits into a longitudinal "long-format" structure.
- **Tech Stack**: `R`, `flexdashboard`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `GitHub Actions`.
- **Impact**: Substantial efficient in study monitoring and influenced biweekly meetings and decisions.
