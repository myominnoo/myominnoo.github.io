## The Challenge
Estimating the Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) is critical for evaluating health interventions. In resource-limited settings like Papua New Guinea, researchers often attempt to use **Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS)** as a proxy for Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). The challenge was to determine if serial MIS data (2013–2020) could provide reliable, sub-national U5MR estimates using indirect estimation methods.

## The Solution: A Methodological Deep-Dive
I applied advanced demographic modeling to three consecutive MIS datasets to test the feasibility of U5MR tracking. Rather than accepting the outputs at face value, I conducted a rigorous validation of the internal and external consistency of the results.

- **Comparative Modeling**: Applied both Maternal Age Cohort-derived (MAC) and Maternal Age Period-derived (MAP) variants of the Rajaratnam et al. (2010) method.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Executed a **1,000-iteration bootstrap simulation** combined with LOESS regression to generate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting standard errors to account for design-driven deflation.
- **Data Quality Audit**: Identified significant discrepancies between the three survey waves, specifically noting "implausible" outcomes, including negative mortality values at the provincial level.

## Technical Deep-Dive
- **Indirect Estimation**: Utilized regression-based models where $U_{ij}$ (country random effects) and parity ratios were used to predict mortality up to 25 years prior to the survey. 
- **R Pacakge**: Given the package's status in the [CRAN Archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/u5mr/), I managed version-specific dependencies to ensure the reproducibility of the maternal age cohort (MAC) and maternal age period (MAP) models
- **Statistical Refinement**: Corrected standard errors by a factor of 4.0 to account for artificial deflation in the simulation.
- **Tech Stack**: `R`, `tidyverse`, `loess`, `boot` (Bootstrapping), `ggplot2`.

## Critical Findings & Lessons
This project served as a vital "proof-of-concept" that revealed the limitations of using MIS data for mortality surveillance in this context:
1. **Unreliability of Small Samples**: Negative U5MR values at the provincial level highlighted the sensitivity of indirect methods to small sample sizes and potential maternal survival bias.
2. **Survey Heterogeneity**: Large gaps between estimates from different survey years suggested possible variations in interview methods or data quality between 2013 and 2019.
3. **Strategic Recommendation**: Provided evidence that while MIS data is excellent for malaria indicators, it may require significant methodological adjustment or larger sample sizes to be a viable substitute for full DHS mortality modules.
