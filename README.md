Welcome to the repo of my personal website, which was created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).


My website is based off of amazing websites by [Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/), [Libby Heeren](https://libbyheeren.com/), and [CÃ‰DRIC SCHERER](https://www.cedricscherer.com/), ! I hope you'll go visit their websites and get inspired. If you particularly like to know more about Quarto website and netlify, you should visit [Jadey's website repo](https://github.com/jadeynryan/jadey_website) and read her blog post on deploying with Netlify (and CI/CD!). You can also draw inspiration from all of the amazing projects on https://quarto.club/
