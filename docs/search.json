I combine my clinical background as a medical doctor with a senior-level expertise in epidemiological research and data science to design research that is methodologically sound, equity-focused, and implementation-ready.\nWith over a decade of experience across academic, clinical, and policy-facing settings, I have led multiple complex research projects globally and published 35+ peer-reviewed papers. My work ranges from advanced statistical modelling of large-scale electronic health records to the development of automated report pipelines and interactive dashboards.\nBy applying a code-first approach in R, I ensure that every analysis is reproducible, transparent, and efficient—whether I am building interactive dashboards, generating dynamic reports, or conducting complex meta-analyses.\nI also frequently engage as a peer reviewer, a mentor, a technical lead, and a data consultant, helping teams strengthen their internal capacity for data wrangling, statistical analysis, pipeline development, and evidence synthesis.\n→     Research Portfolio\n    →     Curriculum Vitae"

In resource-limited settings like Papua New Guinea, researchers often attempt to use Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) as a proxy for Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). The challenge was to determine if serial MIS data (2013–2020) could provide reliable, sub-national U5MR estimates using indirect estimation methods."

Rather than accepting the outputs at face value, I conducted a rigorous validation of the internal and external consistency of the results.\n\nComparative Modeling: Applied both Maternal Age Cohort-derived (MAC) and Maternal Age Period-derived (MAP) variants of the Rajaratnam et al. (2010) method.\nUncertainty Quantification: Executed a 1,000-iteration bootstrap simulation combined with LOESS regression to generate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting standard errors to account for design-driven deflation.\nData Quality Audit: Identified significant discrepancies between the three survey waves, specifically noting “implausible” outcomes, including negative mortality values at the provincial level."

Unreliability of Small Samples: Negative U5MR values at the provincial level highlighted the sensitivity of indirect methods to small sample sizes and potential maternal survival bias. 2. Survey Heterogeneity: Large gaps between estimates from different survey years suggested possible variations in interview methods or data quality between 2013 and 2019. 3. Strategic Recommendation: Provided evidence that while MIS data is excellent for malaria indicators, it may require significant methodological adjustment or larger sample sizes to be a viable substitute for full DHS mortality modules."

    "text": "1 The Challenge\nThe SWOP HPV Study in Nairobi tracks high-risk populations (FSW and MSM) over a one-year period to understand HPV genotype transmission and immunological clearance. Managing longitudinal data for such a study is notoriously difficult; researchers need to monitor “loss to follow-up,” identify patterns in viral persistence across multiple visits, and correlate these with mucosal characteristics in real-time."

The columns “rQ1” to “rQ5” are transformed into two new columns: “level” and “coverage”. The values in the original columns are gathered into the “coverage” column, and the column names are extracted and placed in the “level” column.\nNext, the code uses the mutate() function from the “dplyr” package to modify the “level” column. The str_remove() function from the “stringr” package removes the letter “r” from the beginning of each level. The case_when() function is then used to assign new labels to the levels based on specific conditions. For example, if the level is “Q1”, it is renamed to “Q1 (Poorest)”. Similarly, if the level is “Q5”, it is renamed to “Q5 (Richest)”. If none of the conditions match, the original level value is retained.\nThe resulting data frame “ex” now has the “level” column modified with new labels, representing different quantiles of coverage.\n\n1.2 How pipe |&gt; works\nImagine you have a set of instructions that you need to follow in a specific order. The pipe |&gt; symbol is like a magic wand that helps you pass the results from one instruction to the next, without having to write everything down again.\nFor example, let’s say you have a toy car and you want to make it go faster. You have different steps to follow: first, you need to attach a turbo engine, then add bigger wheels, and finally, give it a fresh coat of paint.\nUsing the magic wand, you can say “Take the car and attach a turbo engine” (car |&gt; attach_turbo_engine), then you can say “Take the result from the previous step and add bigger wheels” (previous_result |&gt; add_bigger_wheels), and finally, you can say “Take the result from the previous step and give it a fresh coat of paint” (previous_result |&gt; give_fresh_coat_of_paint).\nThe magic wand (|&gt;) helps you pass the car from one step to the next, making it faster and more exciting without repeating the same instructions every time.\nIn programming, the pipe symbol works similarly. It allows you to take the output of one operation and pass it directly as input to the next operation, simplifying the code and making it easier to understand and follow the flow of data."

To avoid this, let’s create a function that allows us to reuse the boilerplate code as much as we need. This will help us save time and effort. We can modify the code snippet according to our requirements and then encapsulate it within a function. By doing so, we can easily reuse the code with different datasets or variables.\n\nCodecreate_equiplot &lt;- function(\n        data, x, y, color,\n        xlab = \"Coverage (%)\", \n        ylab = NULL, \n        title = \"Equiplot of XX coverage in 1994\",\n        caption = \"Data source: Int'l Center for Equity in Health | Pelotas\",\n        legend.title = \"Wealth Quintiles\", \n        color_pal = c(\"#15353b\", \"#005766\", \"#46929e\", \"#ffdb83\", \"#ffb403\")) {\n    data |&gt; \n    mutate(x = {{ x }}, \n                 y = {{ y }}, \n                 color = {{ color }}) |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_line(\n        aes(group = y) \n    ) + \n    geom_point(\n        aes(color = color), \n        size = 7\n    ) +\n    # change the color scale to custom colors\n    scale_color_manual(\n        values = color_pal\n    ) + \n    # put legend title to the top over the labels\n    guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = \"top\")) +\n    # add more descriptive labels\n    labs(\n        x = xlab, \n        y = ylab, \n        color = legend.title, \n        caption = caption\n    ) +\n    ggtitle(title) + \n    # change the appearance of the whole graph\n    ggprism::theme_prism(base_size = 10) + \n    theme(\n        # add horizontal grey line\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"grey90\"), \n        # italicize plot caption \n        plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\"), \n        # show legend title \n        legend.title = element_text(), \n        # change legend to the top position\n        legend.position = \"top\"\n    ) \n}\n\n\nLet’s create the same plot for the year 1994.\n\nCodeex |&gt; \n    filter(year == 1994) |&gt; \n    create_equiplot(x = coverage, y = country, color = level, \n                                    title = \"Equiplot showing XX coverage in 1994\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding faceted components based on the year variable can provide additional insights in our visualizations. Here are the updated codes that include faceting:\n\nCodeex |&gt; \n    create_equiplot(x = coverage, y = country, color = level, \n                                    title = \"Equiplot showing XX coverages: 1994-2006\") +\n    # stratified by year \n    facet_wrap(~ year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can customize the theme and labels to improve the appearance and clarity of the faceted graph. Here’s an updated version of the code snippet with a different theme and modified labels:\n\nCodeex |&gt; \n    create_equiplot(x = coverage, y = country, color = level) +\n    facet_wrap(~ year) + \n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"grey90\"), \n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"), \n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16), \n        plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\"), \n        legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"), \n        legend.position = \"top\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Saving plots\nggsave() is a useful function in the ggplot2 package that allows you to save plots in various formats. Here’s an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of ggsave():\n\nCodeggsave(here::here(\"plots\", \"equiplot.png\"), width = 8, height = 6)"

    "text": "1 Email Forwarding with ImprovMX\nImprovMX promises email forwarding in seconds, and the best part—it’s absolutely free forever!\nNow, let’s look at the free plan perks:\n\n1 domain\n25 aliases per domain\n500 incoming emails per day\n10Mb attachment limit\nNormal forwarding speed\nEmail support only\n\nSure, it might not come with all the bells and whistles, but hey, it’s free, and it’s more than good enough for the task at hand! 🌈\n\n1.1 Create an ImprovMX account\n\nVisit ImprovMX.\n\n\n\nEnter your domain (example.com) and the email address you want to forward to (e.g., youraddress@gmail.com).\nClick Create a free alias.\n\nIt will bring you to a new page with some required information to fill in, like your full name and location.\n\n\n1.2 Create Aliases\nTime to get creative! Begin adding aliases like johnsmith@example.com, hello@example.com, sales@example.com, customer@example.com, and the list goes on! 🌟 You can have up to 25 aliases with the free plan.\n\nMission accomplished with your aliases? Sweet! Now, onto the next part—DNS Settings.\n\n\n1.3 Set up DNS setting\nThis section comprises two essential components: 1) MX entries and 2) SPF records. It’s crucial to configure them accurately to authorize ImprovMX for sending emails on your behalf and ensure ImprovMX can efficiently receive and forward your emails. 📧✨\n\nLet’s add these settings into the DNS configuration of your Netlify domain.\nTo do this:\n\n🌐 Log in to your Netlify account.\n🖱️ Go to Domains --&gt; Click your domain name --&gt; Add a new record under DNS settings.\n\n Here is reiteration of what Suppor\nHere is a reiteration of the recommended steps outlined in the Support Guide article:\nThe settings for each record are as follows:\n\nRecord type: Select MX.\nName: Use just the @ symbol; no additional information is needed.\nPriority: An integer; lower numbers indicate higher priority. Set it to the recommended value from your email service provider.\nValue: This should be the server path provided by your email service.\nTTL (Time To Live): This will default to 3600 seconds, and the default setting is usually appropriate.\n\nFor me, I input all three corresponding entries with their respective values. It’s a pretty straightforward process. Once you are set up, the message “Email forwarding needs setup” in red will change to “Email forwarding active” in green. 🟢📬\n\nYou can verify its functionality by clicking on the test button. 🧪\nNow, you’re all set to receive emails addressed to your domain or custom email address. 📧✨"

Here, I’ll walk you through my experience:\n\nEnsure your Gmail account has Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled. If not, you can set it up here.\nGenerate an App Password by clicking here. You’ll need to re-enter your Gmail password for this.\nIn the App name, enter ImprovMX alias and click Create. This will display your app password on a new screen. Keep this screen open in a separate tab; you’ll need the app password for Gmail setup. 🌐🔐\n\n\nNow you’re ready to proceed with the Gmail configuration.\n\nOpen your Gmail (preferably in a separate tab) and navigate to settings. You can do this by going to Settings &gt; See all settings or simply click here.\nIn the Accounts and Import tab, under Send email as:, click Add another email address.\nEnter your email alias in the Email Address field and uncheck “Treat as an alias”. Click Next Step.\nEnter smtp.gmail.com in the SMTP Server, your email address in the Username, and your app password in the Password. Leave the rest as it is. Click “Add Account”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you copy the code, be cautious as it may contain white spaces. The code should be 16 digits long.\n\n\n\nGmail will send you an email requesting confirmation of ownership via a provided link. Simply click on the link to confirm, and you’re good to go!\nFrom now on, you can easily choose your alias from the list when composing a new message."
