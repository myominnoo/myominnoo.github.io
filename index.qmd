**Hi, I am Myo.** ðŸ‘‹

I'm an epidemiologist and health researcher dedicated to advancing equitable healthcare through reproducible data science and R.

> Always coding. Passionate about data science. Worried about health inequity. Proud husband.

Currently, I work for a health economic consulting firm based in Canada. I often contribute as an Academic Editor for PLoS ONE and engage in academic tasks such as peer reviews for select journals. 

Whether you are navigating intricate research designs, decoding complex datasets, or crafting impactful health narratives, I'm here for a meaningful conversation.

I'm thrilled to have you here! Let's embark on an exploration of the captivating world of global health research together!
