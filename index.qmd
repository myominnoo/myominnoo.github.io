**Hi!** ðŸ‘‹ I'm Myo, Sr. Research Associate at Options Lab, MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions. I study why STBBIs and other health issues continue to be a problem and how we can best address them to improve health for underserved communities.  Outside of work, I enjoy biking, exploring, and discovering new interests.

> Always coding. Passionate about data. Worried about health inequity. Proud husband.
