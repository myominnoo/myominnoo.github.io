**Role**: Epidemiologist, Data Lead 

**Position**: Postdoctoral Fellowship @ University of Manitoba

**Domain**: Health Informatics, Clinical Research

## The Challenge
In the [SWOP HPV Study](https://webapps.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/decisions/p/project_details.html?applId=483352&lang=en) in Nairobi, GeneXpert machines provided critical diagnostic data for HPV and CTNG. However, the raw output was semi-structured and difficult to aggregate, creating a bottleneck for longitudinal epidemiological analysis. Manual data cleaning was unsustainable for a high-volume clinical setting.


## The Solution
I developed Xpert Magic, a production-grade Shiny application that automates the transformation of GeneXpert raw outputs into tidy, analysis-ready datasets.

- **Automated Parsing**: Built custom R logic to extract diagnostic results from heterogeneous machine files.
- **Data Integrity**: Implemented real-time validation checks to ensure consistency between HPV and CTNG results.
- **User-Centric Design**: Designed a simple "Upload and Export" interface tailored for lab staff without R experience.

## Technical Deep-Dive
- **Modular R Code**: Organized using a clean directory structure for scalability and maintenance.
- **Tech Stack**: `R`, `Shiny`, `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `DT`, `bs4Dash`, `route`.
- **Impact**: Eliminated manual data entry errors and reduced the clinical data-to-analysis lead time by over 90%.
